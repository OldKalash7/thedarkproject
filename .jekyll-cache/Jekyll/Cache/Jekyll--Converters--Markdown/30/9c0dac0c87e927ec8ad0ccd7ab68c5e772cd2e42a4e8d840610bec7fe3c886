<p>Wow, it‚Äôs been a hell of a month. A lot of stuff has happen in a brief spawn of time and i still need time to process everything. For instance, I got a job! Hurrah. I‚Äôm gonna be a backend developer for a tech company starting in 2 weeks. I‚Äôm a bit anxious about that but I guess it‚Äôs gonna be fine. I‚Äôm really happy for getting my first true programming job, and that‚Äôs my proof that after all overthinking I must do something right. I won‚Äôt have as much time as I have right now but I‚Äôl try my best to keep doing the things a I like the most. So here is a brief summary of what is going on.

<h3 id="godot-wild-jam">Godot Wild Jam</h3>
<p>I participated with some friends in the <a href="https://godotwildjam.com/">Godot Wild Jam</a>, we made a game in <a href="https://godotengine.org/]">Godot</a> in a week. We ended up being 63 of 72, that‚Äôs not impressive but I‚Äôm happy we managed to deliver and not ending last. It was the first time of us as team and my first time too in a jam. The theme of the jam was <em>Lost Tech</em>.</p>

<p>We made a game about the experience of downloading and seeding torrents in the early 2000‚Äôs in Windows XP. The player has to become the top seeder in town, while tries to not get infected with malware and confronting demonic captchas, all in a CRT aesthetic. The game‚Äôs called <em>Craptcha</em>. Currently I‚Äôm working on improving it and fixing it for a release.</p>

<h3 id="learning-rust">Learning Rust</h3>
<p>On another note, I started to learn the Rust Programming Language. So far I‚Äôm taking a slow pace but I‚Äôm interested in what the language is capable of. Mostly thanks to Cargo, the dependencies and build system of Rust. It looks really easy to load or add a new library into a project.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm playing Doom Eternal. My good the game is so good. I‚Äôm having a great time with it, I would like to go for all the achievements but you need to play multiplayer in order to get them all so that‚Äôs a big no for me.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs all for now.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>
