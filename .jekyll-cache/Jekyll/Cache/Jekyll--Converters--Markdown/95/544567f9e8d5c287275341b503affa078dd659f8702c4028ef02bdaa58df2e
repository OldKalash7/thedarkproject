<p>Iâ€™m not dead yet, just a quick update.</p>

<p>The job itâ€™s going well so far. Iâ€™ve been busy doing adult stuff and giving myself some time i needed. Itâ€™s quite complicate to balance your personal life, job, hobbies and friends.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been keeping with learning Rust. Iâ€™m just going slower with it. I really like the language but itâ€™s tricky. Specially all the tings related to borrowing and how the language manages memory on reference types. Although, the thing that I have been struggling the most itâ€™s code organization. Iâ€™m still waiting the get the grasp of it, how to use modules and structure the project in different files. I come from a background heavy on OOP and Java, which organizes code via hierarchies, classes and packages. Rust itâ€™s quite different in that regard, but I like it. Sooner or later I will understand. With patience.</p>

<p>This block of code wonâ€™t compile in Rust. At first glance it should. But It wonâ€™t because how Rust manages memory. See, the owner of the reference type s itâ€™s the main function. When main calls the get_len() function and passes around the s variable itâ€™s also transferring the ownership of that variable to the get_len() function. Unless get_len() returns the value, cannot use s anymore. Thatâ€™s one of the may quirks of Rust. For now I like it enough.</p>

<p>On the other hand <em>Craptcha</em> the game Iâ€™m polishing in order to publish itâ€™s coming along nicely. But Iâ€™m the only programmer on it right now and itâ€™s a bit cumbersome. Specially because it has a lot of UI stuff an managing what is visible to the player and what not etcâ€¦ Iâ€™m making progress but a bit every time. No screenshots for now, but soon, the game will be available to play.</p>

<p>Also, I have created a new twitter account. Later I will update the link a the top of the page.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>
