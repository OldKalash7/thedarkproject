<p>Wow, itâ€™s been a hell of a month. A lot of stuff has happen in a brief spawn of time and i still need time to process everything. For instance, I got a job! Hurrah. Iâ€™m gonna be a backend developer for a tech company starting in 2 weeks. Iâ€™m a bit anxious about that but I guess itâ€™s gonna be fine. Iâ€™m really happy for getting my first true programming job, and thatâ€™s my proof that after all overthinking I must do something right. I wonâ€™t have as much time as I have right now but Iâ€™l try my best to keep doing the things a I like the most. So here is a brief summary of what is going on.</p>

<h3 id="godot-wild-jam">Godot Wild Jam</h3>
<p>I participated with some friends in the <a href="https://godotwildjam.com/">Godot Wild Jam</a>, we made a game in <a href="https://godotengine.org/]">Godot</a> in a week. We ended up being 63 of 72, thatâ€™s not impressive but Iâ€™m happy we managed to deliver and not ending last. It was the first time of us as team and my first time too in a jam. The theme of the jam was <em>Lost Tech</em>.</p>

<p>We made a game about the experience of downloading and seeding torrents in the early 2000â€™s in Windows XP. The player has to become the top seeder in town, while tries to not get infected with malware and confronting demonic captchas, all in a CRT aesthetic. The gameâ€™s called <em>Craptcha</em>. Currently Iâ€™m working on improving it and fixing it for a release.</p>

<h3 id="learning-rust">Learning Rust</h3>
<p>On another note, I started to learn the Rust Programming Language. So far Iâ€™m taking a slow pace but Iâ€™m interested in what the language is capable of. Mostly thanks to Cargo, the dependencies and build system of Rust. It looks really easy to load or add a new library into a project.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m playing Doom Eternal. My good the game is so good. Iâ€™m having a great time with it, I would like to go for all the achievements but you need to play multiplayer in order to get them all so thatâ€™s a big no for me.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all for now.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>
