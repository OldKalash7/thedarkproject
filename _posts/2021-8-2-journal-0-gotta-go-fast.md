Wow, it's been a hell of a month. A lot of stuff has happen in a brief spawn of time and i still need time to process everything. For instance, I got a job! Hurrah. I'm gonna be a backend developer for a tech company starting in 2 weeks. I'm a bit anxious about that but I guess it's gonna be fine. I'm really happy for getting my first true programming job, and that's my proof that after all overthinking I must do something right. I won't have as much time as I have right now but I'l try my best to keep doing the things a I like the most. So here is a brief summary of what is going on.

### Godot Wild Jam
I participated with some friends in the [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com/), we made a game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/]) in a week. We ended up being 63 of 72, that's not impressive but I'm happy we managed to deliver and not ending last. It was the first time of us as team and my first time too in a jam. The theme of the jam was *Lost Tech*.

We made a game about the experience of downloading and seeding torrents in the early 2000's in Windows XP. The player has to become the top seeder in town, while tries to not get infected with malware and confronting demonic captchas, all in a CRT aesthetic. The game's called *Craptcha*. Currently I'm working on improving it and fixing it for a release.

### Learning Rust
On another note, I started to learn the Rust Programming Language. So far I'm taking a slow pace but I'm interested in what the language is capable of. Mostly thanks to Cargo, the dependencies and build system of Rust. It looks really easy to load or add a new library into a project. 


I'm playing Doom Eternal. My good the game is so good. I'm having a great time with it, I would like to go for all the achievements but you need to play multiplayer in order to get them all so that's a big no for me. 

That's all for now.

Take care.
