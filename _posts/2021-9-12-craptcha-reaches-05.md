That's it. *Craptcha* has reached their second milestone. When we submitted the game to the jam back in July the game was roughly and unplayable. The systems where there of course but due to lack of time and other life stuff we couldn't finish putting all the together.  I got the task of fixing it and getting it ready for QA and playtesting. It's been a full month, the entire August and we have reached 0.5 version, I am super excited, the game is playable in this state right now. However, there's still road up ahead.

Initially I wanted to redesign the majority of the systems since there was a lot of repetition and coupling  between them. Also the UI was a mess. So the first thing I did was fixing the UI and trying to make some standards on how the callbacks worked and so. It took me quite a lot of time frankly. From there I redesigned  the main systems of the game (the mail, how the programs work etc...) The last thing I did was setting up the captcha minigame and the score system.

Soon the game will be uploaded to play!

Until then, take care.
